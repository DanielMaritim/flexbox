# flexbox

a simple demo about flexbox and how it differs from the old traditional box method,

Flexbox is pretty awesome and is certainly part of the future of layout. 

We will make a container for our columns a flexbox display context,and 
all direct children of this element become flex items. 

The parent is called the flex container while the children are called the flex items.

It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

By default the flex items(the children) are usually in order as they are placed,but the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container

Flex items ie the children are primarily laid out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.


    row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
    row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
    column: same as row but top to bottom
    column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top
